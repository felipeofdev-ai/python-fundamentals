# 🐍 Python Core Fundamentals (Applied)

Core Python concepts implemented with **clean code practices**, focused on building a strong foundation for backend, automation, and data-driven systems.

This repository demonstrates how fundamental Python concepts are applied in a **structured and production-oriented way**, not just theoretical examples.

---

## 👋 Overview

This project consolidates essential Python concepts used daily in real-world development, including:

- clean function design
- control flow and logic
- data structures
- object-oriented programming
- basic testing mindset

The goal is to demonstrate **engineering fundamentals**, not just language syntax.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### Core Python
- Variables and data types
- Conditional logic and loops
- Functions and arguments
- Basic object-oriented programming (OOP)

### Code Quality
- Clear naming and structure
- Readable, maintainable code
- Modular organization

### Practice
- Mini challenges to reinforce logic and problem-solving
