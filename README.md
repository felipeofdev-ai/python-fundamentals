🐍 Python Fundamentals — Solid Foundations for Real-World Development

A clean, well-structured repository demonstrating strong Python fundamentals, best practices, and readiness for professional software development.

📌 Overview

This repository was created to demonstrate core Python knowledge through clear, practical, and well-organized examples.

It reflects how I write code in real projects:

Readable

Maintainable

Logical

Focused on clarity and correctness

Although it covers fundamentals, the structure and approach follow professional development standards, making it suitable for recruiters and technical reviewers evaluating Python proficiency.

🧠 What This Repository Demonstrates

✔ Solid understanding of Python core concepts
✔ Clean and readable code style
✔ Logical thinking and problem decomposition
✔ Consistent naming and organization
✔ Readiness to work with real-world backend and automation projects
